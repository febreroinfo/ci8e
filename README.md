## What is it?

A tool that assists with project layout problems. It is a fork of [Pesticide](https://github.com/mrmrs/pesticide) that I found useful in my development. I extended the functionality to be keyboard key press activated with the options to toggle between the standard outline option or the enhanced option with box shadow to show element depth on hover.

## Why use it?

Sometimes you need to tell elements apart to identify what's causing the layout issue. This is where this tool comes in and shines.
